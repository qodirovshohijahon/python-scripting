### NTPLIB

The ntplib library is used to oﬀer a simple interface that is used in querying NPT servers using Python. This can be very useful in networking activities since servers need a correct time to be distributed. The time in network server must be kept in mind by many business owners.

The use of this library, therefore, help in synchronizing time in network servers. Time synchronization helps in preventing unauthorized requests from fraudulent individuals. Time synchronization has many advantages in an organizational network. The major advantages being; easy tracking of security breaches, network usage, or problems aﬀecting many components can be nearly impossible if timestamps in logs are inaccurate. Another major advantage is that helps in reduce confusion, especially in shared ﬁlesystems since there needs to be consistency in the modiﬁcation time. This can also be important in billing services and similar ﬁelds where time accuracy is critical.

### Diesel

Diesel is a Python library that provides a framework used in
writing network applications. This framework ensures that
the network applications written are scalable and highly
reliable. It mainly applies the greenlet library layered atop
asynchronous socket I/O in Python. This enhances the need
for achieving the beneﬁts of both the threaded-style and
evented-style. These are the linear and the blocking-ish code
ﬂow for the threated-style and the no locking and the low
overhead per connection for the event-style concurrency paradigms. This design has been mainly inspired by the
Erlang which is also the OTP platform. 

The use of diesel provides a clean API. This API can be used
to write the network servers or network clients or both. The
API also supports the UDP and TCP hence making the process
of writing network applications to be a fun. It bundles battle-
tested clients for HTTP, DNS, Redis, Riak and MongoDB.
The link below is the active directory of Diesel since it is also
an active project.

### Python NMAP

This is a python library that helps programs that uses the
NMAP port scanner. It makes it easy to manipulate NMAP
scan results and produce perfect results. It is a helpful tool
for network engineers who want to automate the scanning of
ports and report generation. They can also be used by
system admins for automated scanning of ports and in
generating reports from the results. This library also supports
NMAP script outputs.

### Scapy

This is a Python library that is used in packet manipulation. It
mainly consists of Python-based programs and libraries.

The library can decode packets with a varied number of
protocols, send the ﬁles on a wire, capture the packets, store
the packets and read the packets using PCAP ﬁles, and even
match the network requests against the replies. Scapy allows
for fast packet prototyping that uses default but working
values.

### Netifaces

This is a Python third party and a portable library. It mainly
enumerates network interfaces in local machines. It reduces
the problems of interfering with network addresses when
making network scripts portable.

### netaddr

This is a library whose main purpose is to represent and
manipulate network addresses.Figure 8-14 Installing netaddr Python Library
It provides support for layer 3 addresses such as IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses, subnets, masks, preﬁxes. It is also
responsible for classifying, slicing and sorting IP networks. It
helps in working with set-based operations over IP
addresses, responsible for parsing diﬀerent notations and
formats, generating DNS reverse lookups and subnetting. In
the layer 2 address, it is responsible for representing and
manipulating MAC addresses and generating IPv6 addresses.

### pyOpenSSL

This library is a thin wrapper used around the OpenSSL
library. It was developed by Python Cryptography Authority.The main function of this library is to support OpenSSL lib. It
implements a high-level interface over the OpenSSL library.

### Pygeocoder

It is used to leverage all public geocoding APIs. These may
include Google's Geocoding API and Yahoo's Place Finder.
Very useful when one has reached the API limit and when the
API in use returns an ambiguous result.

### Pyyaml

It is a data serialization format mainly aimed at human
readability and aids users in interacting with scripting
languages. It is a YAML parser and emitter in Python.

### RequestThis is an HTTP library that is licensed and is written in

Python. It is mainly an Apache2 HTTP and designed to
interact with human language. It helps in a sense that URLs
and POST data are not to be added manually. It allows users
to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python.

### Feedparser

This is a Python library that allows the user to parse feeds in
all known formats. The major formats that this library can
parse include Atom, RSS, and RDF. This library is also able to
parse all the known extension modules such as Apple’s
iTunes and Dublin.

### Paramiko

Paramiko is a Python (2.7, 3.4+) implementation of the
SSHv2 protocol, providing both client and server
functionality. While it leverages a Python C extension for low-
level cryptography (Cryptography), Paramiko itself is a pure
Python interface around SSH networking concepts.

### Fabric

The fabric is a Python library (i.e. a tool to build on ) used for
interacting with SSH and computer systems [easily] to
automate a wide range of tasks, varying from application
deployment to general system administration.

### Supervisor

The supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users
to monitor and control several processes on UNIX-likeoperating systems. It shares some of the same goals of
programs like launched, daemontools, and run it. Unlike
some of these programs, it is not meant to be run as a
substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead, it is meant to be
used to control processes related to a project or a customer
and is meant to start like any other program at boot time

### Xmlrpclib

This is a remote procedure call to method that takes into use
XML that is passed via HTTP(S) as a transport. It enables
client to call methods with restrictions on a remote server
and structured data fo r get back. XML-RPC is the simplest
XML-based protocol for exchanging information between
computers across a network.
• It supports writing XML-RPC client code (Bhushan et al
2009).
• It always handles all the details in translating between XML
on the wire and comfortable python objects

### Construct

The construct is a python library for the construction and
deconstruction of data structures in a declarative fashion. In
this context, construction, or building, refers to the process
of converting (serializing) a programmatic object into a
binary representation. Deconstruction, or parsing, refers to
the opposite process of converting (deserializing) binary data
into a programmatic object. Being declarative means that
user code deﬁnes the data structure, instead of the
convention of writing procedural code to accomplish the
goal. The construct can work seamlessly with a bit- and byte-
level data granularity and various byte-ordering.

### Pandas

This is a python package that is designed to do work with
labeled and relational data intuitive and simple (Radeta et
al., 2018). It is a perfect tool for wrangling data. Panda is
designed for easy and quick data aggregation, manipulation
and visualization (Radeta et al., 2018). It is consisting of two
types that is series one dimensional and data frames which
is two dimensional. Panda enables you to; • Convert datastructures to data frame objects.
• Handle the missing data and represent it as NaNs (Radeta
et al., 2018).
• Delete and add columns from data frame easily.
• Do the powerful grouping by functionality.

### Matplotib

Another python library package that is tailored for just
generating simple and powerful visualization (Lescisin and
Mahmoud 2016). It is a top-notch software piece that makes
python a cognizant competitor to such scientiﬁc tools as
Mathematica or metlab when used together with numpy,
scipy and pandas. This library is quite low meaning that you
will be required to write more codes so that you can reach
the advanced levels of visualization. In metplotib almost
everything is customizable (Lescisin and Mahmoud 2016).This will require more eﬀorts than when using high level
tools but the eﬀort is always worth a shot. Despite that with
little eﬀorts you can be able to come up with;
• Plots including line plots, scatter plot, stem plots, quiver
plots, contour plots among others (Lescisin and Mahmoud
2016).
• Charts including bar charts and histograms, pie charts, and
spectrograms.
• Also, it facilitates creation of label grids, legends and grids.

### SOAPpy

SOAPpy is a simple python library that fully supports
dynamic interaction between the server and the client
(Lescisin and Mahmoud 2016). This library includes SOAP
parser on sax.ml, SOAP builder, SOAP proxy for RPC client
code and SOAP server which is a framework for server code.
SOAPpy has the following features.• It handles faults and all SOAP 1.0 types.
• Allows speciﬁcation of SOAP action and namespace
speciﬁcation.
• Has homogenous typed arrays and it can also support
multiple schemas.
• It has SSL clients and SSL server that can be used on
python when combined with OpenSSL support (Radeta et al.,
2018).
• It has WSDL server and WSDL client support.
